        Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
        Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her
        passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the
        workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
        learning new things from everywhere etc.).: Web-Developer for more than one year. I've experienced in writing
        SPA, testing and debugging. I like studing because I joined RSSchool.

        JavaScript, JS-library: React, methodology: BEM, VC: Git. Others: Webpack,
        SASS/LESS, npm.
      </li>

        Code examples (LATEST):

        <code>
        import { connect } from 'react-redux';
        import { addMessageActionCreator, updateMessageTextActionCreator } from '../../../../redux/messages-reducer';

        import Messages from '../component';

        const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
        dialogs: state.messagesPage.dialogs,
        messages: state.messagesPage.messages,
        messageText: state.messagesPage.messageText,
        });

        const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
        addMessage: () => {
        dispatch(addMessageActionCreator());
        },
        updateMessageText: (text) => {
        dispatch(updateMessageTextActionCreator(text));
        },
        });

        const MessagesContainer = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Messages);

        export default MessagesContainer;

        Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
        freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
        Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code): I participated in EPAM Systems's training project
        in React and also I've done some projects for me.
